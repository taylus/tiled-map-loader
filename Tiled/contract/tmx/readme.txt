Tiled's map format is available from their github repository:
https://raw.github.com/bjorn/tiled/master/docs/map.xsd

It appears to be outdated, though...
It has elements that the TMX Map Format page says are deprecated in Tiled Qt (they were used in Tiled Java)
https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/wiki/TMX-Map-Format

So I edited the XSD manually to make it better match the TMX files saved by Tiled Qt.
These files won't include the xmlns, though, so I place it there before deserializing.

Generate the classes from it using Microsoft's xsd.exe:
